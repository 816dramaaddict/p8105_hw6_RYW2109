The R-squared distribution has a normal distribution, which also
represents the percentage of variance in tmax that is explained by tmin.
The log(Beta0 \* Beta1) distribution also has a relative normal
distribution. Beta0 represents the intercept of the regression model
with Beta1 representing the slope; the product of these two values in
the distribution provides an idea of the uncertainty of the interaction
between the intercept and slope.
